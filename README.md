# Hi — I'm Orlando Bullock 👋

I help startups hire engineers who actually ship — not just ideate.  
At [KBOtek](https://kbotek.com), I partner with founders to find developers who thrive in chaos, move fast, and leave clean commits behind.

Most days you’ll find me somewhere between codebases, founder DMs, and convincing a brilliant engineer to take a leap on their next adventure.
